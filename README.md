## My process

Looking at the image provided, I divided the picture into several areas. During this phase, I determine which HTML elements would be the most useful for a project. Sections, headings, paragraphs, spans, divs, unordered lists and footer element(tags) were the HTML elements/tags that I felt would be the most beneficial. From there, I selected the HTML file and renamed or created the appropriate elements that would be needed to create the price grid areas. Afterwards, I created the CSS file and linked, both, the CSS and fonts that I would be using to the HTML file.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Floats

### What I learned

- Box-shadow property

I particularly proud of the button that I made. It's simple, but was done without help except from the MDN when I couldn't figure out the box-shadow.
```css
.signUp-btn{
    height: 45px;
    width: 65%;
    background: hsl(71, 73%, 54%);
    text-align: center;
    margin: 30px 0 0 50px;
    padding-top: 10px;
    border-radius: 3px;
}

.signUp-btn:hover{
    box-shadow: 1px 5px 8px black;
    cursor: pointer;
}
```

### Continued development

Things I will continue to focus on:
- CSS positions
- CSS flexbox
- GitHub

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - Helped with CSS questions I had while completing this. Give explanations and examples. Great resource for all.
